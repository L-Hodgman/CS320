How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my program is functional and secure by thoroughly testing it. Without testing, there is a big chance the program can't function properly or has serious security risks. When running tests, I will make sure that all the lines of code are covered, the tests pass, all the files work well together, and there are no vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
When figuring out the user needs, it is important to listen to and understand the program's requirements. Also, knowing how the program will be used is a big step in interpreting the users' needs. Then, I would think about how the user will interact with the software. Once this information is clarified, the next step is to develop test cases and design the program around these needs. This aids in having nothing get missed while trying to build the requirements.

How do I approach designing software?
The first important thing with designing software is the client's requirements. Once the requirements are established, using a UML chart method, I quickly draw up a rough draft of the design's components, such as the classes, variables, and methods. Next, I start coding the software. As I am coding, I continuously execute and test the code to make sure everything is working properly.
